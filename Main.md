# The software #

Currently an automated process to create needed files to replicate remote controls is only available for Windows platform; but it is possibile to create such files even by hand, using any O.S. supporting [SOX program](http://sox.sourceforge.net/). SOX is available as:

-Redhat RPM package: i386 binary (Also available for other targets and as Source Code)

-Debian package: Debian's SoX page

-Win32 Binary (Win95/98/NT/XP/Vista): sox-14.0.1.zip

-Win32 Cygwin Binary (With Audio support): sox-14.0.1-cygwin.zip

-NetBSD: Various Binaries

-OS/2 binary: sox-12.17.1.zip

-BeOS Binary: sox-12.18.2-beos-x86-ogg.zip (with MP3 and Ogg), sox-12.18.2-beos-x86.zip and sox-12.18.2-beos-ppc.zip (from [PlanetMir](http://www.planetmir.de/html/softw.htm))

-Atari ST binary: sox12.17.2-m68k-atari.tgz (from [PlanetMir](http://www.planetmir.de/html/softw.htm)) )

-DGJPP DOS Binary


See [SOX home page](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) for details about download. Go to my [SOX](SOX.md) dedicated page to find out how to create your WAV files using SOX.
